    //This is a follow up of Shortest Word Distance.The only difference is now word1 could be the same as word2.

    //Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

    //word1 and word2 may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list.


    //For example,
    //Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

    //Given word1 = “makes”, word2 = “coding”, return 1.
    //Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes", return 3.


    //Note:
    //You may assume word1 and word2 are both in the list.
